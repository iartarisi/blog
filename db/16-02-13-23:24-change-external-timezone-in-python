Change the system timezone for the python interpreter

Wrapping my head around timezones is hard. And testing the implications of working with different timezones is especially difficult since I now live in GMT (which is mostly the same as UTC).

I found a way to change the timezone, that is used by most of python's stdlib, by changing the @TZ@ environment variable:

<pre lang="bash">
$ python -c 'import time; print(time.tzname)'
('GMT', 'BST')
$ TZ='Europe/Stockholm' python -c 'import time; print(time.tzname)'
('CET', 'CEST')
</pre>
