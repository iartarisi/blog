HTTP Status Codes Reference

TIL, REST, API

I've been using this reference for HTTP status codes lately: "http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html":http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html

It's nice to be able to see all of them on one page and expand only the interesting ones.

Just found it the other day from someone mentioning it on StackOverflow. I notice now that it's easily googleable. I hadn't found it before because I always go straight to "Wikipedia":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_418.
