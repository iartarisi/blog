"Fedora Summer Coding":https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010 is now over for me and I'm really glad of what I learned and coded this summer.

Our initial goal was to develop a TurboGears2 Web app and JSON API for "Fedora Copr":https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Copr. When finished, Copr should provide everyone with a place to build Fedora packages and host custom repositories for everyone to enjoy. This is a project that should prove quite popular in the Fedora Community when it gets released and I'm glad to have played a role in its development.

At first I worked on the web app, modeling the database and the relationship between coprs and repos and packages and then developing the JSON API. When the midterm came, my mentor and I decided that I should also contribute to the other parts of Copr. The original schedule had a simple command-line client planned, but we went further than that. In the end all of the functionality of the JSON API also got implemented in a client library (based on and very similar to "python-fedora":https://fedorahosted.org/python-fedora/) and in a command-line client. I also got to dive into python-fedora's and repoze.who's internals in order to get basic HTTP authentication working for TurboGears2.

My latest work has been on the "func":https://fedorahosted.org/func/ module. This is the buildsystem part of Copr. Func minions running this module will be commanded by "headhunter":https://fedorahosted.org/headhunter (Copr's scheduler) to build packages in mock and then move them into repositories. The module also creates, updates and deletes package repositories and will check the built packages for Fedora conformance (e.g. licensing) - this last part is not yet implemented. I got to play with virtual machines and func and "mock":https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock and "createrepo":http://createrepo.baseurl.org/.

There is a more synthethic overview of all the different things that got implemented "on the wiki":https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mapleoin/FSC-Copr-status.

Overall, I'm really glad of what I learned this summer. This project really got me involved in a lot of different levels of the architecture of a web service and a lot of different technologies. Some of the things I worked on looked really scary at first, but as I went nearer and read more code the mist slowly vanished.

My mentor, "Toshio Kuratomi":http://anonbadger.wordpress.com/ was great as always. This isn't the first project I've had him as my mentor. He was always there to talk to and always had great answers to all of my questions. He had great patience in answering and explaining anything I asked about. Our discussions were mostly about the architecture of the app we were building, but he also gave me great tips on the inner workings of python-fedora or on deploying the web app. I felt I had a lot of liberty to decide the way things will get implemented. Regardless of whether we will ever work together again, Toshio will always be a great inspiration for me as a programmer and as a person.
