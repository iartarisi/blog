This blog is running pyblee - a static blogging system written in python. I used a lot of open-source tools to build it: _vim, emacs, python, python-textile, python-BeautifulSoup, python-mako, git, gimp, firebug_. The sources to all this blog are available "on github":http://github.com/mapleoin/maplepink.
