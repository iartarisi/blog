A lot of the inspiration for this blog, and my continued interest in programming, come from "why the lucky stiff":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff. This might partly explain the random jokes. The blog's title uses the word _blahg_, which was how @_why@ referred to weblogs. The other part of the name comes from an electronic jazz band called "Revolution Void":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Void which I was "listening to":/perma/freemusic at the time this blog was started.

This blog is running pyblee - a static blogging system written in python. I used a lot of open-source tools to build it: _vim, emacs, python, python-textile, python-BeautifulSoup, python-mako, git, gimp, firebug_. The sources to this blog are available in "this repository":http://github.com/mapleoin/blog.

Here's my "github profile":http://github.com/mapleoin. You can also figure out how to contact me there.
