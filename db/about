This blog is about.

It's running pyblee - a static blogging system written in python, which is still in a alpha sort of stage. You can watch the show on github, "here":http://github.com/mapleoin/pyblee/tree/master . I'll be writing more about it shortly. 
I used a lot of open-source tools to build it: _vim, python, python-textile, python-BeautifulSoup, python-mako, git, gimp, firebug_.
