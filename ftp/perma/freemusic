        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/freemusic">Living with free music for a year</a></h2>
        <h3>Sunday, January 11, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>It&#8217;s been about a year and a half since I&#8217;ve decided to stop pirating music.</p>
<p>The main reason for me having the courage to do this is because I had found <a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a>. Jamendo is a place for artists to post their <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licensed work and for anyone else to download or stream free of charge. Armed with this and my 20 CD collection, I decided to delete all my previous music collection and start anew.</p>
<p>Let me give you some background on this. My music collection was medium-sized before. As big as any other adolescent&#8217;s. I AM an audiophile, having always listened to a wide range of music, many hours a day and having played piano when I was little and guitar now. I have never actually created any music however. So I&#8217;m probably just your average, bit of an audiophile, Joe.</p>
<p>The plan was: download everything I liked from jamendo and then buy some 1&#8211;2 CDs/month. I kept to it. I also created a new <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fuhur">last.fm profile</a> to track my listening habits and to supplement them with their streaming feature. My motivation was to keep everything legal and ogg. The same way I have no pirated software on my computer I could have no pirated music. The world would be a better place.</p>
<p>In the glory days, I used to download 10 albums a day from jamendo. I generally kept them for 2&#8211;3 weeks so I could listen to them at least twice and then deleted what I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>I found some amazing artists I could never have found in the mainstream like <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/the.octave.band">The Octave Band</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/Tom_Fahy">Tom Fahy</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/revolutionvoid">Revolution Void</a> and <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/noise.sound.nation">Noise sound nation</a> . I also found some that could&#8217;ve made it to the mainstream, but didn&#8217;t: <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/officialwhiteroom">WhiteRoom</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/whiteyes">Whiteyes</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/eternaltango">Eternal Tango</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/tryad">try^d</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/contreband">Contreband</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/hype"><span class="caps">HYPE</span></a> etc. There was a lot of bad music and a lot of experiments. But hey! There&#8217;s a lot of bad music in the mainstream, too, although not as much experiments because that&#8217;s not what mainstream is for.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t complain about the quality of the music, but I can complain about the quality of the audio files on the site and the site itself which is probably the most-failed-startup-that-could&#8217;ve-been-big in existence. Jamendo has oggs, but you can only get them via bittorrent and nowadays they don&#8217;t work most of the time. The website is a nightmare as far as usability is concerned and the design is from the 90s. Jamendo has a lot of potential and I heard it&#8217;s big in France, but I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s stopping them from being big on the Web.</p>
<p>Back to my experience. I had a lot of fun and I really didn&#8217;t miss much of the music I had been listening to before. I could always brag to my friends and recommend them artists that they had never heard of. I could listen to awesome new sounds, some of which could be called: melancholic noise music, trance jazz, psychedelic bored music etc.</p>
<p>My legal music collection is now 12G big with 113 artists, 23 of which are ripped cds. It&#8217;s all ogg. <br />
These days I&#8217;m beginning to get bored and annoyed with jamendo&#8217;s mismanagement. I haven&#8217;t downloaded a new jamendo album in months and that&#8217;s not because I haven&#8217;t tried.<br />
The interest in me keeping this legal music collection just faded. I&#8217;ve lost motivation. Also, there are a lot of commercial artists that sound interesting and that I can&#8217;t buy locally. Music isn&#8217;t like software. You can&#8217;t replace an artist with another just because they&#8217;re in the same genre. With software you have to get something done, regardless of the means. With music, you&#8217;re not just listening to <em>music</em>, the means is the purpose and every artist is irreplaceable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably going to migrate my music collection to flac files since my audiophile needs have just become more aristocratic after I bought a new hi-fi head-set. I&#8217;m still going to be watching the artists I love from jamendo that no one will ever hear about. I might even go on a raid or two at the bay of pirates.</p>
