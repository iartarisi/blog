        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/productive-programmer-review">The Productive Programmer</a></h2>
        <h3>Friday, September 18, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>Today I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596519788?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596519788">The Productive Programmer</a> .</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already got a bunch of books piled up and waiting to be read, some of which I&#8217;ve reached the middle of and some of which I&#8217;ve read only the introduction to. I was bored today and this looked like an easy read that I could drop at any time. It is an easy read, but the fact is, it&#8217;s very catchy. It draws you in and doesn&#8217;t want to be let go. It&#8217;s a great way to spend half a day.</p>
<p>This could have been another one of those &#8220;94 things you need to know&#8221; books, but I think this title is way better. The tips are divided into 2 big sections and a few separate chapters within each one, giving the book some structure. One of the strange things about it is that its advice spans across 3 different platforms (*nix, OS X and Windows) and they&#8217;re all mingled together in the same chapter. I was put off by this at first, but after I&#8217;d gotten into the book a bit I realized that it is, in fact, a good idea. The whole theme of the book is programmer productivity and the reason it has this title and not a cheesy title with numbers like &#8220;94.3 productivity tips for programmers&#8221; is that the tips aren&#8217;t what&#8217;s important. The book is there to hit people in the head with and open their minds. You aren&#8217;t supposed to just use the tips provided, that&#8217;s unimportant. What&#8217;s important is that you have a shock and realize that you&#8217;ve been the wrong kind of lazy as a programmer. You&#8217;ve stopped automating, you&#8217;ve become a machine; in the author&#8217;s own words, computers have started &#8220;getting together late at night to make fun of their users&#8221;. As soon as I realized what this book was really about, I started reading the Windows tips as well. I also stopped a few times to look in my distro&#8217;s repository for tools that I had known of, but never used before, only now understanding their true purpose. There are many applications that seem just trendy at first, until you realize that even a small productivity boost is a big productivity boost. (Go check out <i>gnome-do</i> , I&#8217;d heard about it years ago, but never tried it until now).<br />The book contains tips ranging from application launchers, Firefox&#8217;s magic address bar, bash scripting commands to office productivity tips for killing distractions. Once again, the mindset is important, not the tips themselves. The big take-away from this book is beginning to constantly judge everything you do as a programmer. This isn&#8217;t new advice (at least for those who have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>&#8221;, which by the way is mentioned several times in this book), but I find it&#8217;s better emphasized in this book. At one point in the book, the author explains how it took his team one hour to devise a Ruby script to automate some simple task that would&#8217;ve required 10 minutes if done manually and finally only needed doing 5 times. One could say there was a loss in productivity, but as the author points out, one would be wrong. Those 50 minutes would&#8217;ve been spent with the brain turned off, whereas the hour writing the script was spent <i>learning</i>, focusing, practicing, gaining knowledge that can later be used on a different project. Some of us would probably have gotten bored in those 50 minutes and fallen into procrastination. That doesn&#8217;t happen when you&#8217;ve got a complex problem to solve.<br />That was the first part of the book, <i>Mechanics</i>. The second part, <i>Practice</i> is a bit harder to read, as it&#8217;s not just disparaged tips on very different applications. They&#8217;re quite two separate books actually. The majority of the examples in Part IIare java (they&#8217;re mostly readable even for someone who doesn&#8217;t speak the exact dialect of <span class="caps">OOP</span> that java uses) and this part is mostly about software <i>construction</i> as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">Steve McConnell</a> would say, but it&#8217;s also about Java. I learned a new acronym: <acronym title="You Ainâ€™t Gonna Need It">YAGNI</acronym> which basically means that thinking ahead is bad. This is probably one of the advices that I feel the least guilty about, but which I sometime observe in people around me. Never program a feature you don&#8217;t urgently have a need for.<br />One of the good points of this book is the originality with which the ideas are expressed. Most of these ideas aren&#8217;t new, especially to anyone who&#8217;s read other software engineering books. The text is spiced up with little narratives of different adventures from the author&#8217;s experience as a consultant and there is also an <i>Ancient Philosophers</i> chapter and an explanation of the PacMan game&#8217;s way of functioning (although I didn&#8217;t understand how that&#8217;s supposed to make the game less enjoyable).</p>
