        <h3>Friday, September 18, 2009</h3>

            <div style="float: left; padding: 1em">

</div>
<p>Today I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596519788?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596519788">The Productive Programmer</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already got a bunch of books piled up and waiting to be read, some of which I&#8217;ve reached the middle of and some of which I&#8217;ve read only the introduction to. I was bored today and this looked like an easy read that I could drop at any time. It is an easy read, but the fact is, it&#8217;s very catchy. It draws you in and doesn&#8217;t want to be let go. It&#8217;s a great way to spend half a day.</p>
<p>This could have been another one of those &#8220;94 things you need to know&#8221; books, but I think this title is way better. The tips are divided into 2 big sections and a few separate chapters within each one, giving the book some structure. One of the strange things about it is that its advice spans across 3 different platforms (*nix, OS X and Windows) and they&#8217;re all mingled together in the same chapter. I was put off by this at first, but after I&#8217;d gotten into the book a bit I realized that it is, in fact, a good idea. The whole theme of the book is programmer productivity and the reason it has this title and not a cheesy title with numbers like &#8220;94.3 productivity tips for programmers&#8221; is that the tips aren&#8217;t what&#8217;s important. The book is there to hit people in the head with and open their minds. You aren&#8217;t supposed to just use the tips provided, that&#8217;s unimportant. What&#8217;s important is that you have a shock and realize that you&#8217;ve been the wrong kind of lazy as a programmer. You&#8217;ve stopped automating, you&#8217;ve become a machine; in the author&#8217;s own words, computers have started &#8220;getting together late at night to make fun of their users&#8221;. As soon as I realized what this book was really about, I started reading the Windows tips as well. I also stopped a few times to look in my distro&#8217;s repository for tools that I had known of, but never used before, only now understanding their true purpose. There are many applications that seem just trendy at first, until you realize that even a small productivity boost is a big productivity boost. (Go check out &#8220;gnome-do&#8221;, I&#8217;d heard about it years ago, but never tried it until now).</p>
<p>The book contains tips ranging from application launchers, Firefox&#8217;s magic address bar, bash scripting commands to office productivity tips for killing distractions. Once again, the mindset is important, not the tips themselves. The big take-away from this book is beginning to constantly judge everything you do as a programmer. This isn&#8217;t new advice (at least for those who have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> , which by the way is mentioned several times in this book), but I find it&#8217;s better emphasized in this book. At one point in the book, the author explains how it took his team one hour to devise a Ruby script to automate some simple task that would&#8217;ve required 10 minutes if done manually and finally only needed doing 5 times. One could say there was a loss in productivity, but as the author points out, one would be wrong. Those 50 minutes would&#8217;ve been spent with the brain turned off, whereas the hour writing the script was spent <strong>learning</strong>, focusing, practicing, gaining knowledge that can later be used on a different project. Some of us would probably have gotten bored in those 50 minutes and fallen into procrastination. That doesn&#8217;t happen when you&#8217;ve got a complex problem to solve.</p>
<p>That was the first part of the book, <em>Mechanics</em>. The second part, <em>Practice</em> is a bit harder to read, as it&#8217;s not just disparaged tips on very different applications. They&#8217;re quite two separate books actually. The majority of the examples in Part IIare java (they&#8217;re mostly readable even for someone who doesn&#8217;t speak the exact dialect of <span class="caps">OOP</span> that java uses) and this part is mostly about software <strong>construction</strong> as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httpmapleoinb-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">Steve McConnell</a> would say, but it&#8217;s also about Java. I learned a new acronym: <acronym title="You Ain’t Gonna Need It">YAGNI</acronym> which basically means that thinking ahead is bad. This is probably one of the advices that I feel the least guilty about, but which I sometime observe in people around me. Never program a feature you don&#8217;t urgently have a need for.</p>
<p>One of the good points of this book is the originality with which the ideas are expressed. Most of these ideas aren&#8217;t new, especially to anyone who&#8217;s read other software engineering books. The text is spiced up with little narratives of different adventures from the author&#8217;s experience as a consultant and there is also an <strong>Ancient Philosophers</strong> chapter and an explanation of the PacMan game&#8217;s way of functioning (although I didn&#8217;t understand how that&#8217;s supposed to make the game less enjoyable).</p>

        <h3>Friday, September 11, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>With <span class="caps">GSOC</span> now over, which I should write a blogpost about soon, I&#8217;ve taken a break from pkgdb and web programming and started developing another skill.</p>
<p>The fact that <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/mapleoin">this page</a> is empty has been bugging me for too much time, so I set out to fix it. I also wanted to find out more about the packaging process and the road of a package before it gets accepted into fedora&#8217;s official repos which is a bit complex. This knowledge would also help me better understand the parts of pkgdb which packagers interact with.</p>
<p>It was not my first time trying to make a package for fedora. I think this is actually my third time. I&#8217;d given up before, scared by all the different tools and scattered documentation. In a previous life, I had made some <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> packages, but the experience is a lot different. I&#8217;m now starting to get used to all the different tools that I was scared of before, like mock and rpmlint and I can now find my way around the fedora wiki for package related information. There is a wealth of information in the wiki, but you need a lot of patience.</p>
<p>I started slow, with quite a complex application to package: <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">Calibre</a> . Having all those different distros is great when you&#8217;re a packager, because you have somewhere to look for help and the Debian package of calibre helped me a lot. It took me about two days to get a somewhat acceptable version of calibre packaged, which I then posted to redhat&#8217;s bugzilla. The following days I found more small apps to be packaged and it became easier and easier for me to do it. Last night for example, I was just browsing <a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> as usual when I found a link to <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=301">facebook&#8217;s opensourcing of their web server framework</a> I just rushed to the download and installation instructions page and I quickly got it packaged. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s perfect, it probably needs a lot of improvement, but it was fun to do. It&#8217;s fun to think that you&#8217;re making things easier for someone and learning a lot at the same time. I now have 5 packages waiting to be reviewed and I&#8217;ve found someone willing to sponsor me into the <em>packager</em> group. Anyone in a package-review mood? ;)</p>
<p>My journey into the packaging world has been enlightening so far and the good thing is I&#8217;m just beginning. There&#8217;s a whole new world to be discovered out there and also another part of the fedora community. </p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/fedora-business-cards">Fedora Business Cards</a></h2>
        <h3>Friday, April 24, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>A few days ago, me and a few friends from Fedora Romania decided we&#8217;d like some fedora business cards for the upcoming eLiberatica conference. <a href="http://ianweller.org">Ian Weller</a> had already developed an official <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Business_cards">template</a> and even created a cool python generator script and packaged it.</p>
<p>The problem, however, was that it only supported US-style business cards which are a bit smaller than the Romanian/Central European ones. Live and learnâ&euro;Ś It seems that there are a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cards#Dimensions">different sizes</a> actually.</p>
<p>So I got my hacking hat and dived in. The code was quite nice to look at and easy to understand. The <span class="caps">XML</span> in the svg templates is quite easy to hack, too. Especially when using tools like python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.minidom.html">minidom</a> . It makes working with python and <span class="caps">XML</span> taste like javascript dom manipulation which is quite nice.</p>
<p>Everything went smooth, I renamed a few tags, made some modifiable (for height and width), but then I had to make the blue strip on the right of the front of the business card extendable1 . There is no way in <span class="caps">XML</span> to align an element to the right so I spent about an hour coming up with a sweet solution. Instead of having a big white background on which I would apply the blue band, I made a big blue background and made the white background just a little narrower. Because the white background was on top of the blue one, it could get aligned to the left (x=0, y=0 in <span class="caps">XML</span>) and cover just the part that needed to be white, and left a blue band at the right. Problem solved. Hoo-grah!</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m waiting for an answer to the patch that I sent to bugzilla. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be accepted and will be available in Fedora, soon, so that others may enjoy and cherish the coolness that it be!</p>
