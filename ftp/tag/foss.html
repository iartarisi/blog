        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/the-late-fedora-summer-coder">The late Fedora Summer coder</a></h2>
        <h3>Sunday, July 25, 2010</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>I started my <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010">Fedora Summer Coding</a> last week. Although most people started almost two months ago, I chose (and was allowed to &#8211; Yay, <acronym title="Fedora Summer Coding">FSC</acronym>!) a different schedule because I just finished college last week.</p>
<p>This summer I&#8217;ll be working on a new project for Fedora &#8211; <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Copr">Copr</a>. Fedora Copr will allow any Fedorian to have their own package repository with packages built and hosted by <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Infrastructure">Fedora&#8217;s Infrastructure</a>. My mentor this summer will be <a href="http://anonbadger.wordpress.com/">Toshio</a>, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed working with him and this summer will be no different. <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010_proposal_-_Copr_TG_app">Here</a> is my actual <acronym title="Fedora Summer Coding">FSC</acronym> proposal. Although the things written in that proposal are turning out to be a bit inaccurate, it&#8217;s still a good bird&#8217;s eye view of what I&#8217;m going to do this summer. </p>
<p>So about the first week. Things started really slow. I did a lot of orientation, certainly more than I thought I would. I hadn&#8217;t used TurboGears2 before, though I had worked with TurboGears 1.x on <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb">Fedora&#8217;s pkgdb</a>. When I started out I had only a TG2 automatically generated skeleton app &#8211; well it&#8217;s mostly the same now, though at least I now know a lot more about what&#8217;s in there. The fact that I had to start it up myself meant I had to learn a lot of things about TG2 that I would&#8217;ve normally just copied from other parts of a fully-functional project. And that was a great experience. In a way it&#8217;s fulfilling to be able to <em>pioneer</em> things in this way ;). I&#8217;m trying to only ask my mentor questions about designing the actual app and solve my &#8220;How do I &#8230; in TurboGears/Python?&#8221; questions elsewhere. My mentor has always given me a lot of independence when working on things and that feels really good, though at times I feel inexperienced. There&#8217;s the thought that the project I&#8217;m working on will be used by a lot of technical users and I&#8217;m really not sure what my decisions&#8217; impact will be on the whole project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly on time with my <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_Coding_2010_proposal_-_Copr_TG_app#Timeline">mock-up schedule</a> because I had set the first week for orienteering. I also wrote the DB schema for Coprs, though that was on the second week. That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m ahead of schedule however, because I&#8217;ll probably have a lot to work on the Copr controllers, and a lot of documenting and designing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud that I setup testing after a day of wading through the scattered documentation of TurboGears2 testing. There&#8217;s mostly no documentation on testing on the <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/2.0/docs/toc.html">TurboGears2.0 docs website</a>. So I went to the <a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.2/">python nose</a> webpage. But they don&#8217;t have any info on the TurboGears2 web helpers which I needed to use. So I went to <a href="http://pylonsbook.com/en/1.1/testing.html">pylonshq docs about testing</a>, but they use a slightly different syntax because they&#8217;re using paste.fixture. I finally found the <a href="http://turbogears.org/2.1/docs/main/Testing/index.html">TurboGears2.1 testing docs</a> which was what I really needed. It turns out that TurboGears 2.x uses <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/webtest/">WebTest</a>.</p>
<p>So now I have testing. My project is not supposed to have any web interface at this point, so writing tests is the easiest way to prove that things are actually working.</p>
<p>This next week I&#8217;ll probably get some work done on Copr controllers. Implementing the ability to <span class="caps">CRUD</span> Coprs and Repos.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/actualizare-automata-metadata-yum">Cum să actualizezi metadatele yum în mod automat</a></h2>
        <h3>Thursday, March 18, 2010</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>Unul dintre lucrurile care mă enervează cel mai tare ca utilizator desktop la yum e că de fiecare dată când vreau să caut sau să instalez un pachet, trebuie să aștept câteva secunde bune până își actualizează metadatele pentru toate depozitele active. Astăzi am avut timp să caut o metodă de a scăpa de neplăcerea asta și a fost destul de simplu de găsit.</p>
<p>Rezolvarea nu este să dezactivăm complet actualizarea metadatelor, pentru că am putea încerca să instalăm pachete a căror dependințe au fost actualizate și a căror versiune exactă nu se mai găsește în depozit => <em>dependency hell</em>.</p>
<p>Se pare că există un program <em>yum-updatesd</em> (<code>su -c &#34;yum install yum-updatesd&#34;</code>) care poate actualiza automat metadatele.</p>
<p>După ce l-am instalat, putem modifica <code>/etc/yum/yum-updatesd.conf</code> dacă vrem să facem lucruri dubioase, cum ar fi să îl lăsăm să instaleze actualizări automat &#8212; pentru că trăim într-o utopie în care actualizările nu strică niciodată nimic &#8212; sau, mai puțin dubios, doar să le descarce.</p>
<p>Acum că am terminat cu setările, putem porni serviciul cu:</p>
<div class="Bash"><div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="nv">$ </span>su -c <span class="s2">&quot;service yum-updatesd start&quot;</span>
 <span class="nv">$ </span>cacamaca
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Și îl putem pune să se pornească automat la fiecare boot:</p>
<div class="Bash"><div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="nv">$ </span>su -c <span class="s2">&quot;chkconfig yum-updatesd on&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

        <h3>Friday, September 11, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>With <span class="caps">GSOC</span> now over, which I should write a blogpost about soon, I&#8217;ve taken a break from pkgdb and web programming and started developing another skill.</p>
<p>The fact that <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/mapleoin">this page</a> is empty has been bugging me for too much time, so I set out to fix it. I also wanted to find out more about the packaging process and the road of a package before it gets accepted into fedora&#8217;s official repos which is a bit complex. This knowledge would also help me better understand the parts of pkgdb which packagers interact with.</p>
<p>It was not my first time trying to make a package for fedora. I think this is actually my third time. I&#8217;d given up before, scared by all the different tools and scattered documentation. In a previous life, I had made some <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> packages, but the experience is a lot different. I&#8217;m now starting to get used to all the different tools that I was scared of before, like mock and rpmlint and I can now find my way around the fedora wiki for package related information. There is a wealth of information in the wiki, but you need a lot of patience.</p>
<p>I started slow, with quite a complex application to package: <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">Calibre</a>. Having all those different distros is great when you&#8217;re a packager, because you have somewhere to look for help and the Debian package of calibre helped me a lot. It took me about two days to get a somewhat acceptable version of calibre packaged, which I then posted to redhat&#8217;s bugzilla. The following days I found more small apps to be packaged and it became easier and easier for me to do it. Last night for example, I was just browsing <a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> as usual when I found a link to <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=301">facebook&#8217;s opensourcing of their web server framework</a> . I just rushed to the download and installation instructions page and I quickly got it packaged. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s perfect, it probably needs a lot of improvement, but it was fun to do. It&#8217;s fun to think that you&#8217;re making things easier for someone and learning a lot at the same time. I now have 5 packages waiting to be reviewed and I&#8217;ve found someone willing to sponsor me into the <strong>packager</strong> group. Anyone in a package-review mood? ;)</p>
<p>My journey into the packaging world has been enlightening so far and the good thing is I&#8217;m just beginning. There&#8217;s a whole new world to be discovered out there and also another part of the fedora community. </p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/GSOC-it-begins">GSOC - it begins...</a></h2>
        <h3>Thursday, April 23, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
             <p>My Fedora proposal got accepted to this year&#8217;s Google Summer of Code Program. You can look at a short abstract <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/redhat/t124024691190">here</a> . Now I&#8217;m going to try to explain what this project is about and what I did to prepare for being accepted, hopefully without going mad about how happy I am about it.</p>
<p>I started work on the Fedora Project almost a year ago. One day I popped on the mailing list and then on the irc channel of the infrastructure team and asked for something to do. Luckily, Toshio Kuratomi was on the watch and after giving me a short tour of the various projects he could help me get familiar with, I picked the package database. Most of the work I&#8217;ve done so far is in the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/">pkgdb</a> (the search capability is the most obvious thing I worked on). The overview on the front page describes it quite well; it&#8217;s got package information and it&#8217;s aimed at package developers. It&#8217;s not a very famous part of the fedora project websites, certainly not as famous as something like packages.ubuntu.com is for ubuntu. But that&#8217;s not what it was intended for, even if that&#8217;s what attracted me to the project at first. I liked the exposure of such a website, but also the fact that, at the time, it was easier for me to understand what it did and how it worked :).</p>
<p>The idea of making the package database more user-friendly as opposed to developer-centric wasn&#8217;t a new one. Toshio, the main developer had been thinking about it for a long time, but I guess it never really became a priority. The idea had also been <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SummerCoding/2008/Ideas#Package_WebUI">proposed</a> for last year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GSOC</span>, but it hadn&#8217;t been accepted (this scared me a bit when I found out). I picked this idea on a whim when I told Toshio I wanted to participate in this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GSOC</span> on pkgdb and he asked me what exactly I wanted to do. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the question, so I answered with the first thing that came to mind. Looking back, I think it was a good choice.</p>
<p>All my involvement with the Fedora Project owes a lot to the best possible person who could have become my mentor for <span class="caps">GSOC</span>. The Infrastructure Team is a great one to work with, and the Fedora contributor community is made up of a lot of smart, fun and selfless people. I say this after having spent a lot of time lurking the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channels, the various mailing lists, the planet etc. and to a somewhat lesser extent interacting with other contributors. However, I wouldn&#8217;t have continued contributing if it weren&#8217;t for the continuous support and guidance of Toshio. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to participate in the <span class="caps">GSOC</span> without the many discussions (starting in February) with Toshio about the proposal and the support when explaining the idea to other community members. Having said that, I think that being familiar with the pkgdb also helped a lot with writing the proposal. I didn&#8217;t have to waste time on getting to know the code, the community, the devs as I would have if I had written a proposal for a different project. I also had a fair idea of what would constitute a good proposal and a rough idea about how it could be implemented. I think this helped with my credibility in the eyes of the mentors who ranked my proposal.</p>
<p>I was never convinced I would get a spot on Fedora & JBoss&#8217;s <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/redhat">accepted proposal&#8217;s list</a> , but it was is a great thing to dream of. The butterflies in my stomach were killing me at the end of the waiting period, especially since it had lasted for more than 2 months. I now have a summer to work full time on my hobby :).</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, the fedora community will hopefully have a package database with package versions, size, dependencies, rss feeds, tagging, package reviews etc. There&#8217;s even a detailed <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb/wiki/EndUserUI">schedule</a> from my proposal you can drool on if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>And hello, fedora planet! Sorry for being late.</p>
