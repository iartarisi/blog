        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/fedora-business-cards">Fedora Business Cards</a></h2>
        <h3>Friday, April 24, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>A few days ago, me and a few friends from <a href="http://fedoraproject.ro">Fedora Romania</a> decided we&#8217;d like some fedora business cards for the upcoming <a href="http://eliberatica.ro">eLiberatica</a> conference. <a href="http://ianweller.org">Ian Weller</a> had already developed an <em>official</em> <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Business_cards">template</a> and even created a cool python generator script and <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/fedora-business-cards">packaged it</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, however, was that it only supported US-style business cards which are a bit smaller than the Romanian/Central European ones. Live and learn&#8230; It seems that there are a <strong>lot</strong> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cards#Dimensions">different sizes</a> actually.</p>
<p>So I got my hacking hat and dived in. The code was quite nice to look at and easy to understand. The <span class="caps">XML</span> in the svg templates is quite easy to hack, too. Especially when using tools like python&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.minidom.html">minidom</a>. It makes working with python and <span class="caps">XML</span> taste like javascript dom manipulation which is quite nice.</p>
<p>Everything went smooth, I renamed a few tags, made some modifiable (for height and width), but then I had to make the blue strip on the right of the front of the business card extendable<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1" title="Are you still with me? Good.">1</a></sup> . There is no way in <span class="caps">XML</span> to align an element to the right so I spent about an hour coming up with a sweet solution. Instead of having a big white background on which I would apply the blue band, I made a big blue background and made the white background just a little narrower. Because the white background was on top of the blue one, it could get aligned to the left (x=0, y=0 in <span class="caps">XML</span>) and cover just the part that needed to be white, and left a blue band at the right. Problem solved. Hoo-grah!</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m waiting for an answer to the patch that I sent to bugzilla. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be accepted and will be available in Fedora, soon, so that others may enjoy and cherish the coolness that it be!</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Are you still with me? Good.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/GSOC-it-begins">GSOC - it begins...</a></h2>
        <h3>Thursday, April 23, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>My Fedora proposal got accepted to this year&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code Program</a>. You can look at a short abstract <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/redhat/t124024691190">here</a>. Now I&#8217;m going to try to explain what this project is about and what I did to prepare for being accepted, hopefully without going mad about how happy I am about it.</p>
<p>I started work on the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora Project</a> almost a year ago. One day I popped on the mailing list and then on the irc channel of the infrastructure team and asked for something to do. Luckily, Toshio Kuratomi was on the watch and after giving me a short tour of the various projects he could help me get familiar with, I picked the package database. Most of the work I&#8217;ve done so far is in the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/">pkgdb</a> (the search capability is the most obvious thing I worked on). The overview on the front page describes it quite well; it&#8217;s got package information and it&#8217;s aimed at package developers. It&#8217;s not a very famous part of the fedora project websites, certainly not as famous as something like packages.ubuntu.com is for ubuntu. But that&#8217;s not what it was intended for, even if that&#8217;s what attracted me to the project at first. I liked the exposure of such a website, but also the fact that, at the time, it was easier for me to understand what it did and how it worked :).</p>
<p>The idea of making the package database more user-friendly as opposed to developer-centric wasn&#8217;t a new one. Toshio, the main developer had been thinking about it for a long time, but I guess it never really became a priority. The idea had also been <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SummerCoding/2008/Ideas#Package_WebUI">proposed</a> for last year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GSOC</span>, but it hadn&#8217;t been accepted (this scared me a bit when I found out). I picked this idea on a whim when I told Toshio I wanted to participate in this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GSOC</span> on pkgdb and he asked me what exactly I wanted to do. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the question, so I answered with the first thing that came to mind. Looking back, I think it was a good choice.</p>
<p>All my involvement with the Fedora Project owes a lot to the best possible person who could have become my mentor for <span class="caps">GSOC</span>. The Infrastructure Team is a great one to work with, and the Fedora contributor community is made up of a lot of smart, fun and selfless people. I say this after having spent a lot of time lurking the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channels, the various mailing lists, the <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org">planet</a> etc. and to a somewhat lesser extent interacting with other contributors. However, I wouldn&#8217;t have continued contributing if it weren&#8217;t for the continuous support and guidance of Toshio. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to participate in the <span class="caps">GSOC</span> without the many discussions (starting in February) with Toshio about the proposal and the support when explaining the idea to other community members. Having said that, I think that being familiar with the pkgdb also helped a lot with writing the proposal. I didn&#8217;t have to waste time on getting to know the code, the community, the devs as I would have if I had written a proposal for a different project. I also had a fair idea of what would constitute a good proposal and a rough idea about how it could be implemented. I think this helped with my credibility in the eyes of the mentors who ranked my proposal.</p>
<p>I was never convinced I would get a spot on Fedora &amp; JBoss&#8217;s <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/redhat">accepted proposal&#8217;s list</a>, but it <del>was</del> is a great thing to dream of. The butterflies in my stomach were killing me at the end of the waiting period, especially since it had lasted for more than 2 months. I now have a summer to work full time on my hobby :).</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, the fedora community will hopefully have a package database with package versions, size, dependencies, rss feeds, tagging, package reviews etc. There&#8217;s even a detailed <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/packagedb/wiki/EndUserUI">schedule</a> from my proposal you can drool on if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>And hello, fedora planet! Sorry for being late.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/ultimate-freebsd-desktop">the ultimate FreeBSD desktop (without a mouse)</a></h2>
        <h3>Tuesday, February  3, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>I installed FreeBSD a few days ago, because I wanted to work on a distribution that&#8217;s famous for its code quality and good practices. I had been using Fedora for almost a year, after switching from ArchLinux which I think I had used for two years and various other Linux distros before that. I had messed around with various BSDs before (OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD), but none of them really stuck with me. One of the big reasons for switching was getting tired of not having a package for that new thing I just saw on reddit. I used to go search for it on <a href="http://freshports.org">freshports</a> everytime and everytime it was already there.</p>
<p>After installing the base system, the first thing was to get some sort of <acronym title="Window Manager">WM</acronym> installed. I was in a bit of a hurry, anxious to get my new system ready, so I didn&#8217;t want anything big, like a <acronym title="Desktop Environment">DE</acronym> . <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">Tiling WMs</a> are the next big thing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_%28computing%29"><span class="caps">WIMP</span></a> is dead. I had played with dwm/wmii before, but these didn&#8217;t really stick then. I think there&#8217;s an effort to be made in order to change your desktop paradigm, just like when you&#8217;re changing your editor or anything else. You can&#8217;t just use it casually once a week and expect to become proficient with it in a month. It doesn&#8217;t work that way. At least not for me. These things cause a bit of a headache. It&#8217;s like cutting a limb. You&#8217;re brain needs to adapt your other senses and limbs to compensate for the loss. But in this case, when you cut your limb, you get a new cyber-robotic-megatron arm instead. You just need to figure it out how it works and your productivity will increase exponentially.</p>
<p>So i installed <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a> , then switched to <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a> and then switched to <a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm/">dwm</a> in a matter of minutes. I then opened up the configuration file for dwm, and changed some keybindings and some colors and two days later it feels like home.</p>
<p>Early on, as I got the tiling wm installed I thought about trying to live without my mouse. That&#8217;s hardcore productivity staring me in the face. Especially the hardcore part. I already had my vim/emacs editor so nothing to change there.</p>
<p>Browsing is a big part of our lives, and browsing can&#8217;t be done without a pointing device. Or could it? I installed <a href="http://vimperator.org/trac/wiki/Vimperator">vimperator</a> . You have these nice key-bindings for moving around (j,k,C-d,C-u,search etc.), but how do you click links? Vimperator has this awesome feature called <em>hinting</em> that highlights and gives a number to each link on the screen when you press <strong>f</strong>. I think it&#8217;s actually faster than moving your mouse around. You can open a new link just by pressing <strong>o</strong>, a tab by pressing <strong>t</strong>. It knows you mean google if you just give it words instead of a url. It goes back and forth with C-o, C-i. It can do almost everything firefox can do and more without looking around through ugly menus. It&#8217;s even got macros! Granted, it takes some getting used to, but that&#8217;s the fun, right?</p>
<p>Everyone already knows irssi the irc client and mutt the email client. You can try those. Or you could use one of emacs&#8217;s. That&#8217;s the next big part of my plan. I&#8217;m going to be switching over to emacs after about 3 years with vim. I&#8217;m probably going to say other things about this move some other time, so I&#8217;ll just summarise my first thoughts until now. I want my editor to be everywhere I edit text. Vim is already in my blog posts and in my source files. But I want my editor in my email, in my shell, in my chat client and under my pillow. Emacs 22 has ugly fonts, but Emacs 23 has antialiased fonts and what do you know? FreeBSD&#8217;s got a port of the development version. All the carpal syndrome scare goes away once you remap Caps to be another Ctrl key. Read a lot of tutorials. Read a lot of high-profile users&#8217; blog posts (like <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/effective-emacs">steve yegge&#8217;s</a> ). Have a lot of commitment and you&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>Learning one of the two editors is a rewarding experience in itself. Vimtutor and the emacs tutorial are amazing. They&#8217;ll have you crackling once every few lines at the new magic powers you&#8217;ve just gained. They truly are great weapons in any mastermind-bent-on-world-domination&#8217;s arsenal.</p>
<p>The first few hours after the second few hours spent into the new environment are the most important. If you can get to this stage, the battle is almost won. The first <em>session</em> is the most troublesome. Your brain revolts and refuses to adapt to the <em>new way</em> . That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s most important to not give up. Spend the night with the new environment and go to sleep. The next day you have to be able to wake up in the same environment and everything will seem natural in a little while. Try it.</p>
<p>Next year I&#8217;ll go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a> .</p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/freemusic">Living with free music for a year</a></h2>
        <h3>Sunday, January 11, 2009</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>It&#8217;s been about a year and a half since I&#8217;ve decided to stop pirating music.</p>
<p>The main reason for me having the courage to do this is because I had found <a href="http://jamendo.com">Jamendo</a>. Jamendo is a place for artists to post their <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licensed work and for anyone else to download or stream free of charge. Armed with this and my 20 CD collection, I decided to delete all my previous music collection and start anew.</p>
<p>Let me give you some background on this. My music collection was medium-sized before. As big as any other adolescent&#8217;s. I AM an audiophile, having always listened to a wide range of music, many hours a day and having played piano when I was little and guitar now. I have never actually created any music however. So I&#8217;m probably just your average, bit of an audiophile, Joe.</p>
<p>The plan was: download everything I liked from jamendo and then buy some 1&#8211;2 CDs/month. I kept to it. I also created a new <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/fuhur">last.fm profile</a> to track my listening habits and to supplement them with their streaming feature. My motivation was to keep everything legal and ogg. The same way I have no pirated software on my computer I could have no pirated music. The world would be a better place.</p>
<p>In the glory days, I used to download 10 albums a day from jamendo. I generally kept them for 2&#8211;3 weeks so I could listen to them at least twice and then deleted what I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>I found some amazing artists I could never have found in the mainstream like <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/the.octave.band">The Octave Band</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/Tom_Fahy">Tom Fahy</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/revolutionvoid">Revolution Void</a> and <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/noise.sound.nation">Noise sound nation</a> . I also found some that could&#8217;ve made it to the mainstream, but didn&#8217;t: <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/officialwhiteroom">WhiteRoom</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/whiteyes">Whiteyes</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/eternaltango">Eternal Tango</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/tryad">try^d</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/contreband">Contreband</a>, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/hype"><span class="caps">HYPE</span></a> etc. There was a lot of bad music and a lot of experiments. But hey! There&#8217;s a lot of bad music in the mainstream, too, although not as much experiments because that&#8217;s not what mainstream is for.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t complain about the quality of the music, but I can complain about the quality of the audio files on the site and the site itself which is probably the most-failed-startup-that-could&#8217;ve-been-big in existence. Jamendo has oggs, but you can only get them via bittorrent and nowadays they don&#8217;t work most of the time. The website is a nightmare as far as usability is concerned and the design is from the 90s. Jamendo has a lot of potential and I heard it&#8217;s big in France, but I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s stopping them from being big on the Web.</p>
<p>Back to my experience. I had a lot of fun and I really didn&#8217;t miss much of the music I had been listening to before. I could always brag to my friends and recommend them artists that they had never heard of. I could listen to awesome new sounds, some of which could be called: melancholic noise music, trance jazz, psychedelic bored music etc.</p>
<p>My legal music collection is now 12G big with 113 artists, 23 of which are ripped cds. It&#8217;s all ogg. <br />
These days I&#8217;m beginning to get bored and annoyed with jamendo&#8217;s mismanagement. I haven&#8217;t downloaded a new jamendo album in months and that&#8217;s not because I haven&#8217;t tried.<br />
The interest in me keeping this legal music collection just faded. I&#8217;ve lost motivation. Also, there are a lot of commercial artists that sound interesting and that I can&#8217;t buy locally. Music isn&#8217;t like software. You can&#8217;t replace an artist with another just because they&#8217;re in the same genre. With software you have to get something done, regardless of the means. With music, you&#8217;re not just listening to <em>music</em>, the means is the purpose and every artist is irreplaceable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably going to migrate my music collection to flac files since my audiophile needs have just become more aristocratic after I bought a new hi-fi head-set. I&#8217;m still going to be watching the artists I love from jamendo that no one will ever hear about. I might even go on a raid or two at the bay of pirates.</p>

        <h3>Friday, December 19, 2008</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>It&#8217;s distro-hopping season again and I chose debian this time. I might explain my reasons for that somewhere else. Here&#8217;s a list of stuff I need to do on every install in order to get comfy with my new distro. (There&#8217;s a sort of meme floating around).<br />
I use gnome!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get 6 virtual desktops. </li>
<li>Set some basic can&#8217;t-live-without-keybindings Ctrl+<em>number</em> for switching between desktops and Alt+T for launching a gnome-terminal.</li>
<li>Clean up my desktop. I really hate every kind of clutter on my desktop, so I delete everything. Almost everything can just be deleted, except for the Home, Trash and Computer icons. Fire up <code>gconf-editor</code> and go to <em>apps>nautilus>desktop</em> to uncheck everything. While we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s also enabling deleting in <em>nautilus</em> (it normally only lets you send stuff to Trash), by checking enable_delete in <em>nautilus>preferences</em>. Nautilus>Edit>Preferences>Behaviour &#8211; always open in browser windows &#8211; so it doesn&#8217;t spam me with 1000 windows to the world.</li>
<li>Next is <code>&lt;package manager&gt; install bash-completion</code> and adding this to my <em>.bashrc</em>: <code>. /etc/bash_completion</code>.</li>
<li>Time to get my .vimrc from wherever i happen to be keeping it at the time. you can check it out now <a href="http://mapleoin.fedorapeople.org/vimrc">here</a>.</li>
<li>Nowadays, as I&#8217;ve got really lazy, I also set up automatic login (you can do that from <em>System>Administration>Login Window</em>. That basically bypasses gdm.</li>
<li>Get myself into some better groups like: wheel/admin/sudo, storage/disk(so nautilus can mount disks), by editing <code>/etc/group</code>.</li>
<li>You might also want to take a look at <a href="http://art.gnome.org">http://art.gnome.org</a> if you&#8217;re the type. I know it&#8217;s a bit outdated, but the interface is a whole lot better than *-look.org</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s a list of apps I use regularly: <em>Firefox, gnome-terminal, vim, ipython, git, xchat, evolution, pidgin, deluge, banshee/amarok, gnome-mplayer</em>.</li>

        <h3>Tuesday, December  9, 2008</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s vim tips:</p>
<p><code>quvawgUq</code></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s break that. If you&#8217;ve ever read any kind of vim tutorial, you&#8217;re probably familiar with it&#8217;s recording feature (otherwise do this: <code>:h recording</code> <span class="caps">NOW</span> <span class="caps">GODAMMIT</span>!). So we first choose a letter for our recording (i chose <strong>u</strong>). Afterwards, we go into <span class="caps">VISUAL</span> <span class="caps">MODE</span> (<strong>v</strong>), then we select a(<strong>a</strong>) word(<strong>w</strong>) and uppercase(gU) it (You could also lowercase it by using <strong>gu</strong> instead). So now, that we&#8217;ve stored our magic in the u key, we can use it on any word with <strong>@u</strong>.</p>
<p><code>:TOhtml</code></p>
<p>For people who can&#8217;t be bothered to install those cool plugins on their blog (or make their own) &#8211; now you have a way to output all the html+formatting with this plugin. It&#8217;s got cool options to use your own css <code>:h TOhtml</code> . Here&#8217;s a sneakpeek:</p>

<p><code>&#8212;<span class="caps">VISUAL</span> <span class="caps">BLOCK</span>&#8212;</code><br />
There&#8217;s a wonderful way to indent many lines and then unindent them in vim. You can select a block in vim (like a rectangle) by using the <em>visual block</em> mode. Press <code>Ctrl-v</code>. Now you can delete that or if you&#8217;d rather, you can replace it with zeroes by doing <code>r0</code>. To indent a block you would go to the first character on the line, get into <em>visual block</em> mode, and press <code>j</code> until you&#8217;ve selected all your desired lines. Now comes the magic: press <code>I</code> (that&#8217;s an uppercase i) and your desired indenting or number of zeroes if that&#8217;s what you like and then escape. You can thank me for the enlightening now.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://mapleoin.bluepink.ro/perma/django-comments-fields">Django comments fields</a></h2>
        <h3>Sunday, October 19, 2008</h3>
        <div class="entry">
            <p>Upon reading the nice <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/#module-django.contrib.comments">documentation</a> for the new comment framework in django 1.0, one might wonder what are the fields attached to the comment entity which you are to iterate against:</p>
<div class="Python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">comment</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">comment_list</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span>
     <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">endfor</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There&#8217;s something wrong in that code. The ellipsis!<br />
So what should you write in there? There&#8217;s no mention of the comment fields in the docs, so I put on my rubber boots and got down to my dbshell so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>

<p>You can play with the <em>is_public</em> and <em>is_removed</em> fields in the admin site <del>and you can also modify any other fields in your users&#8217; posts</del>. You could also use the <em>ip_address</em> field to display <a href="http://coulix.net/blog/2006/aug/17/ip-country-flags-django-comments/">country flags in your comments</a> .</p>
<p>The django comments provide a spam-fighting technique by default, in the form of a <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/#notes-on-the-comment-form">honeypot</a> (though I wonder how effective that is) as well as other extras. There are rumours that some sort of captcha system (some say <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCaptcha</a> ) will be integrated in the django comments framework.</p>
<p>Take more risks! Live more dangerously!</p>
<p>Update: I filed the <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9563">documentation patch</a> and it got accepted (although largely rewritten ;) ). The process took about 3 months :|.</p>
