h1. My static blogging system

This is a python3 project.

Syntax highlighting code blocks is done with "pygments":http://pygments.org/ syntax by using @<pre lang="<your lang>"> </pre>@ blocks. *Note:* blank lines inside the @pre@ blocks break the syntax highlighting.

h3. Run it

Blog post sources are stored in @db/@.

Create a directory called @ftp@ (yeah, I'm that old) where all the static blog files will be output. That directory is not included in this repository because it is usually a symlink to a different repository or subrepository.

Then do something like this:

<pre lang="bash">
$ pip install -r pip-requires
$ ./pyblee.py
</pre>
